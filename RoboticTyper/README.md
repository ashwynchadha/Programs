Files in this directory are programs written for the LegoNXT. My team and I rebuilt and reconfigured a LegoNXT along with a touch and light sensor as well as some motors to work as a robotic typing machine. The programming, as it is currently written, is configured to to let the machine take raw text input via bluetooth. The sensors are used to map the keyboard that is being used. The intensity sensor is used to find and stop at keys. A two dimensional array is used to store the locations for different keys. Functionality has been added for uppercase and lower case keys, as well as for new lines, carriage returns, and other grammatical additions. Every twenty keys, the motors carry over too much error, so the touch sensors at the bottom left are used to reset location, which solves this problem.

This program was built to help anyone who is disabled. Being able to use a computer is an increasingly essential skill. We didn't have the resources to use voice recognition software, but the idea was that anyone who couldn't type could use our machine. Configured to the voice recognition instead of raw text, the machine will take input from an individual's voice, and type it into the keyboard.
