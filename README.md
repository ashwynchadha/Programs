# Programs
This is a collection of small programs that I made on my spare time using RobotC/High Level C/C++. These programs were made in an effort to learn and understand programming. There is a focus on Data Structures and Algorithms as well as on design strategies. There are implementations of Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks and other classes, with some miscellaneous programs to learn about filing, input output stream and other functions.
Since these programs were made in an effort to learn, early compilers such as Borland's Turbo C++ were used. These programs do not use namespaces and do fulfill C++ 11 requirements, and hence cannot be compiled using GNU GCC, DevC++, or any other modern compilers. 
NOTE: Most of this code was written more than 3 years ago, and as such, has not been reviewed, edited or improved. It would not be productive to adapt these programs to modern compilers as I would not learn anything.
Most of my subsequent work has been under NDA or has since been made proprietary, and therefore cannot be shown.
